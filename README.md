### Installation
Create a copy of this and clone/download to your local computer. Then, navigate there from the command-line.

```
cd ~/Desktop/yelp-app/
```

Use Anaconda to create and activate a new virtual environment, perhaps called "yelp-env":

```
conda create -n yelp-env python=3.8
conda activate yelp-env
```

Then, within an active virtual environment, install package dependencies:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
